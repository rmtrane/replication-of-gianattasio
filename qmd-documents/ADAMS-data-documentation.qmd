## ADAMS data structure

The ADAMS data is downloaded as five .zip files: one with tracker data (`adams1trk.zip`), and one for each of the four waves (`adams1a.zip`, `adams1b.zip`, `adams1c.zip`, `adams1d.zip`). To prepare to run the SAS files to reproduce @gianattasioComparisonMethodsAlgorithmic2019 from the [github repo](https://github.com/powerepilab/AD_algorithm_comparison), these need to be unzipped. This reveals more .zip files, one of which is named `adams1Xsas.zip` for wave `X`. Unzip these. 

## RAND Data

These scripts use an older version of the RAND data files, the so-called RAND Version P. This can be found under archived files [here](https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/rand-hrs-archived-data-products). 

Need to create the formats using something along the lines of this:

```
libname library "/path/to/sasfmts.sas7bdat";
  proc format library=library cntlin=linbrary.sasfmts;
run;
```


## HRS Data

Need to run .SAS files to create the data sets needed.
