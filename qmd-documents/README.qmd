## Introduction

This repo aims at replicating the results of @gianattasioComparisonMethodsAlgorithmic2019.

## Run

Unzip all .zip files downloaded from HRS website. Will throw an error if any needed .zip files are missing. This unzips the files to the folder `data/HRS-unzips/`. 

```
make unzip_all password="placeyourpasswordfromHRSforADAMSzipfileshere"
```

Create a formats file for RAND data.

```
make data/SAS/rand/formats.sas7bcat
```

Update all sas files. This replaces file paths in the SAS files from the HRS and ADAMS SAS files downloaded from HRS website. The updated SAS files are placed in `data/HRS-unzips/{subdir}/new_sas` where `{subdir}` 

```
make update_all_sas
```

Next, we run all the SAS files to create SAS data sets for use later. The created datasets are placed in the `data/SAS/{HRS,ADAMS}` folders.

```
make run_all_sas
```

Now, we need to download the SAS scripts used by @gianattasioComparisonMethodsAlgorithmic2019. The next command clones [their GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/powerepilab/AD_algorithm_comparison) and checks out the commit that was used for this work. (As of the creation of this, the most recent commit is the used commit, but in case of any future changes, we fix the used commit.)

```
make AD_algorithm_comparison
```

The filepaths in the just downloaded SAS scripts need to be updated as well.

```
make update_AD_algorithm_comparison
```
